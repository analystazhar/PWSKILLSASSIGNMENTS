    "A pair confusion matrix is a variation of the traditional confusion matrix that is specifically designed for ranking and binary \n",
    "classification problems where you are interested in comparing the rankings or preferences of pairs of instances. It is used in \n",
    "scenarios where the primary goal is to rank or order instances rather than assigning them to specific classes. Pair confusion \n",

    "\n",
    "Here's how a pair confusion matrix differs from a regular confusion matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Pairs of Instances:In a regular confusion matrix, you typically have rows and columns representing the actual and predicted \n",
    "    class labels. Each entry in the matrix corresponds to the classification of a single instance. In contrast, a pair \n",
    "    confusion matrix deals with pairs of instances.\n",

    "    preferred item.\n",
    "\n",
    "   -Kendall's Tau: A correlation coefficient that measures the similarity in rankings between the model and the true rankings.\n",

    "\n",
    "Here's how extrinsic measures are typically used to evaluate the performance of language models in NLP:\n",
