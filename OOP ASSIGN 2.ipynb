In object-oriented programming, classes provide a way to define objects with certain properties and methods, but hide the underlying implementation details from the rest of the code. For example, you can define a class with public methods that expose its behavior, but keep the implementation details private.\n",

Interfaces are used to define a common set of behaviors that can be implemented by different classes, without specifying the implementation details. For example, in Java, you can define an interface that specifies the methods that must be implemented by a class that implements the interface.\n",

Information hiding is used to protect the internal state of an object from being modified by external code, and to provide a clear and well-defined way for other objects to interact with the object.\n"
